/********************************************************************************
	Create the empty SQLite (schema) database for the ocRosa iOS client.
	This database is bundled with the iOS App and deployed to the device on 
	first-launch.
	
	Reminder: Any changes to this schema (table names, column names) will need
    to be reflected in the corresponding xCode project.
	
	As a convention primary keys are called "dbid" to distinguish from XML strings
	called "id" in the incoming xForms documents.
	
	A Reminder about Foreign Keys: FK support is OFF by default and must be
	enabled at run-time (for each db connection) by calling

		PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON;

*********************************************************************************/

/* 
	The OpenRosa specification defines xForm embedded in a 'container' XML document
    (usually an xHTML document). For reference, the basic hierarchy looks like this:

	-- Begin xhtml document
	<html>
		<head>
			<meta/>
			<title/>
			<xf:model>
				<xf:instance>
					-- XML instance --
				</xf:instance>
				<xf:bind/>
				<xf:bind/>
				<xf:bind/>
				...
			</xf:model>
		</head>
		
		<body>
			<!-- Controls -->
			<xf:input>
			<xf:input>
		</body>
	</html>
	-- End xhtml document
	
	After initial download, the container document is parsed and the various
	xForms elements are extracted and stored in this SQLite database.
*/

-- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

/* 
	The Forms table is the entry point into the parsed-and-stored xForm.
	
	During parsing, the xForms model, instance, bindings and controls are
	extracted from an incoming XML or XHTML document and stored in this
	database.

	Parsing occurs within a single SQL transaction and rolled-back if
	parsing fails for any reason.  Thus, there are no 'orphaned' model,
	instance, bindings or controls entries.

	This means that we can start with the dbid of a parsed 'Form' and walk
	the record hierarchy to build-up all the elements necessary to work 
	with the form. Since everything we need to present/display/fill-out the
	form is in this database, we never need to load the entire original
    XML/XHTML document once parsing is complete.
